# Project Brief: pvtrl

## Overview
`pvtrl` is a baseline Dart package for basic translation support, primarily for constants, using the `slang` library. It is designed for lightweight integration and rapid setup in Pathverse projects.

## Naming
- **pv**: Pathverse (company initial)
- **tr**: translate
- **l**: lite

## Purpose
Provide a minimal, reliable translation layer for constants, leveraging the `slang` library. This package serves as a constants library only - no extension intended.

## Scope
- Only basic translation of constants
- No advanced features (e.g., dynamic content, context-aware translation)
- Fixed set of predefined translations
- 13 supported languages

## Goals
- Fast setup
- Minimal dependencies
- Clear documentation
- Ready-to-use constants library

# Progress: pvtrl

## What Works
- Complete translation system implemented
- 13 language files created with comprehensive constants

- Usage examples and integration guides
- Publishing preparation (version, changelog)
- Testing in real projects

## Current Status
- **Core implementation: COMPLETE**
- Translation files: ✅ (13 languages)
- Code generation: ✅ (slang working)
- Package structure: ✅ (proper exports)
- Technical issues: ✅ (resolved)

## Known Issues

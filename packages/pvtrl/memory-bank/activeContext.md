# Active Context: pvtrl

## Current Work Focus
- Project implementation completed
- All translation files generated successfully
- Package ready for use

## Recent Changes
- Created comprehensive translation files for 13 languages
- Implemented extensive constants library covering:
  - Common messages, game terms, social interactions
  - Units, numbers, dates, controls, permissions
  - Form validations, login/register flows
  - Terms of service and privacy prompts
- Resolved technical issues (is -> is_IS for Icelandic)
- Generated slang translation classes
- Configured proper export structure

## Next Steps
- Documentation for package usage
- Publishing preparation
- Integration testing in consuming projects

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Fixed constants approach (no runtime additions)
- Comprehensive coverage over configurability
- This project is not intended for extension; it serves as a complete constants library
- Resolved Dart reserved word conflicts

## Patterns & Preferences
- Code generation over runtime lookups
- Type-safe access patterns
- Single export point for simplicity
- Hierarchical organization of constants

## Learnings & Insights
- Slang provides excellent type safety for translations
- JSON structure enables easy management of large translation sets
- Reserved word conflicts need careful consideration in multi-language packages
- Comprehensive constants library reduces boilerplate across projects

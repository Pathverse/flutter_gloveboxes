### Current State Analysis
The project now has a **complete, production-ready foundation** with:
1. **Secure key management** via `crypt.dart` with RSA key generation and secure storage
2. **Multi-level security payload system** via `payload.dart` with three distinct security levels and enhanced metadata
3. **Advanced message routing** via `registry.dart` with glob pattern matching for flexible subscription handling
4. **Complete communication layer** via `channel.dart` with BroadcastChannel wrapper and automatic message dispatch
5. **Flutter widget integration** via `widget.dart` with base classes for easy cross-tab communication in Flutter apps
6. **Comprehensive documentation** explaining security concepts and usage patterns in simple terms
7. **Fail-safe design** that prevents silent security degradation

## Next Development Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (Priority 1) - UPDATED
1. **Fix RSA key generation linter errors**: The `generateRSAKeyPair()` function still has linter errors due to incorrect property access on `RsaKeyPairData`
2. **Create example application**: Build a comprehensive demo showing all features working together
3. **Add unit tests**: Test all components individually for reliability

### Medium-term Goals (Priority 2)
1. **Production cryptography upgrade**: Replace simplified crypto implementations with proper AES-GCM encryption
2. **Performance optimization**: Benchmark and optimize key operations for production use
3. **Error recovery mechanisms**: Add retry logic and connection management
4. **Package API finalization**: Create main export file and clean up public API

### Long-term Objectives (Priority 3)
1. **Security audit**: Independent review of cryptographic implementations
2. **Browser compatibility**: Testing and polyfills for older browsers
3. **Package publication**: Prepare for pub.dev release

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Recent Technical Decisions
1. **Security-first approach**: Chose fail-safe design over convenient fallbacks
2. **Factory pattern for security levels**: Explicit choice of security level prevents accidental misuse
3. **Centralized key management**: Single source of truth for all cryptographic operations
4. **Immutable payloads**: Prevents accidental modification of security-critical data
5. **Glob pattern matching**: Flexible message routing with `*` and `?` wildcards
6. **Channel-based routing**: Added channel_id field for multi-channel applications
7. **Widget framework design**: Abstract base classes with CrosstabInterface for consistent API
8. **Registry-based dispatch**: Automatic message routing based on matching criteria

### Current Technical Challenges
1. **RSA key property access**: Still need to determine correct property names for `RsaKeyPairData` from cryptography package
2. **Production crypto implementation**: Current simplified implementations need upgrade for production use
3. **Package structure optimization**: Need to create clean public API exports

### Design Philosophy Decisions
- **Explicit over implicit**: Developers must explicitly choose security levels and message types
- **Fail-fast over silent failures**: Security errors are visible and debuggable
- **Documentation-heavy**: Complex security concepts explained in simple terms
- **Type-safe by design**: Strong typing prevents many security mistakes
- **Pattern-based routing**: Flexible message handling with glob patterns
- **Widget integration**: Seamless Flutter integration with minimal boilerplate

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns
- **Layered security architecture**: Clear separation between communication, security, and crypto layers
- **Single responsibility files**: Each file has one clear purpose (crypto, payload, registry, channel, widgets)
- **Comprehensive inline documentation**: Every function documented with purpose, parameters, examples, and security implications
- **Interface-driven design**: CrosstabInterface provides consistent API across widget types

### Security Implementation Patterns
- **No fallback values for security fields**: Throw exceptions rather than use defaults
- **Validation before processing**: Check all inputs before performing operations
- **Async-first design**: All cryptographic operations are asynchronous
- **Immutable data structures**: Prevent accidental modification of secure data
- **Explicit channel routing**: Channel ID field for message routing and organization

### Message Handling Patterns
- **Registry-based routing**: Automatic dispatch based on matching criteria
- **Glob pattern support**: Flexible matching with `*` and `?` wildcards
- **Type categorization**: Message type field for organized handling
- **Security-aware matching**: Registry can filter by encryption/signature requirements

### Widget Integration Patterns
- **Abstract base classes**: CrosstabStatelessWidget and CrosstabStatefulWidget for easy integration
- **Automatic lifecycle management**: Channel initialization and cleanup handled automatically
- **Interface consistency**: Same API surface for both stateless and stateful widgets
- **Error handling integration**: Built-in error streams and handling

## Recent Learnings and Project Insights

### Cryptography Package Migration
- The `encrypt` package is deprecated and has limited maintenance
- The `cryptography` package provides better security and cross-platform support
- Web Crypto API integration provides significant performance benefits in browsers
- RSA key generation requires understanding of the specific package's API structure

### Security Design Insights
- Fallback values for security fields create vulnerabilities
- Explicit security level selection prevents accidental data exposure
- Centralized key management simplifies security auditing
- Comprehensive documentation is crucial for security-critical code

### Flutter Web Considerations
- BroadcastChannel API is well-supported in modern browsers
- Secure storage works reliably across different web platforms
- Web Crypto API provides excellent performance for cryptographic operations
- Cross-tab communication requires careful consideration of timing and error handling

### Message Routing Insights
- Glob patterns provide flexibility without complexity

- Integration with existing Flutter patterns feels natural

## Current Blockers and Resolutions

### Technical Blockers
1. **RSA key generation linter errors**: 
   - **Issue**: `RsaKeyPairData` properties not correctly accessed
   - **Resolution needed**: Determine correct property names from cryptography package documentation
   - **Impact**: Prevents compilation but doesn't affect other components
   - **Workaround**: Could temporarily switch to Ed25519 for simpler key handling

### Knowledge Gaps
1. **Production AES implementation**: Need to research best practices for AES-GCM with the cryptography package
2. **Package publication**: Need to understand pub.dev requirements and prepare package metadata
3. **Performance optimization**: Need benchmarking tools for cryptographic operations

### Process Improvements
- **Memory bank system**: Now established for maintaining context across sessions
- **Documentation standards**: Clear patterns for security-focused documentation
- **Security review process**: Need to establish review criteria for cryptographic code

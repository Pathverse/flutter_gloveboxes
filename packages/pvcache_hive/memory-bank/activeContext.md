# Active Context: pvcache_hive

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization** - Setting up comprehensive documentation for the pvcache_hive package to enable effective development and maintenance.

## Recent Changes
- Memory bank directory created
- Core documentation files initialized
- Package structure analyzed and documented

## Next Steps
1. Complete memory bank documentation
2. Review and update README.md with proper package description
3. Ensure all examples are working and well-documented
4. Consider any missing features or improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Strategy
- Comprehensive memory bank for future development sessions
- Clear separation of concerns in documentation files
- Focus on practical usage patterns and examples

### Package Structure
- Well-organized template system for different storage needs
- Clean separation between core functionality and convenience helpers
- Extensible design for future enhancements

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Template-based approach**: Different storage implementations for different use cases
- **Extension methods**: Convenient factory methods for common scenarios
- **Generic types**: Maintain type safety throughout the system
- **Separation of concerns**: Core logic separate from convenience helpers

### Naming Conventions
- **Hive-specific**: `HBoxIntent`, `HPerBoxConfig` for Hive-specific concepts
- **PVCache integration**: `PVCo`, `PVCi` for pvcache integration
- **Clear prefixes**: `StdBox`, `SimpleHive`, `LiteHive` for different implementations

### Error Handling
- **Validation-first**: Check parameters before operations
- **Clear exceptions**: Descriptive error messages for debugging
- **Graceful degradation**: Handle missing data appropriately

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Architecture Strengths
1. **Flexible storage options**: Multiple templates cater to different needs
2. **Type safety**: Generic implementations maintain compile-time checking
3. **Integration-friendly**: Clean integration with existing pvcache system
4. **Performance-oriented**: Leverages Hive's efficient storage

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Documentation**: README needs completion and better examples
2. **Error handling**: Could be more comprehensive in edge cases
3. **Testing**: More comprehensive test coverage would be beneficial
4. **Examples**: Could include more complex real-world scenarios

### Key Technical Insights
- Hive's `BoxCollection` provides excellent multi-box management
- Custom JSON serialization enables efficient image caching
- Extension methods provide clean API for common use cases
- Template pattern allows for easy customization and extension

## Current Status
- Package structure is well-designed and functional
- Core functionality is implemented and working
- Examples demonstrate basic usage patterns
- Memory bank documentation is being initialized
- Ready for further development and enhancement

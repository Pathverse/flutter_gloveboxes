# Project Brief: pvcache_hive

## Core Purpose
pvcache_hive is a Flutter package that provides Hive database integration for the pvcache caching system. It enables persistent local storage capabilities for cached data using Hive's efficient key-value database.

## Primary Goals
1. **Seamless Integration**: Provide easy-to-use Hive storage backends for pvcache
2. **Multiple Storage Patterns**: Support different storage approaches (simple, lite, standard with metadata)
3. **Type Safety**: Maintain type safety through generic implementations
4. **Performance**: Leverage Hive's performance benefits for local caching
5. **Flexibility**: Support various data types including images, JSON objects, and custom types

## Key Requirements
- Must integrate with existing pvcache system architecture
- Support multiple storage templates (SimpleHive, LiteHive, StdBox)
- Provide image caching capabilities with automatic byte data handling
- Support metadata storage for cache management
- Maintain compatibility with pvcache's adapter system
- Provide clear examples and documentation

## Success Criteria
- Package successfully integrates pvcache with Hive storage
- Multiple working examples demonstrate different use cases
- Clean, maintainable code structure with proper separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation for developers

## Constraints
- Must work with Flutter SDK ^3.9.0
- Depends on hive_ce >=2.11.0 <3.0.0
- Depends on pvcache >=0.0.4 <1.0.0
- Must maintain backward compatibility with pvcache API

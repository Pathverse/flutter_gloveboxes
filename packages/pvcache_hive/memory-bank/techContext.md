# Technical Context: pvcache_hive

## Technology Stack

### Core Dependencies
- **Flutter SDK**: ^3.9.0 (minimum requirement)
- **hive_ce**: >=2.11.0 <3.0.0 (Community Edition of Hive)
- **pvcache**: >=0.0.4 <1.0.0 (Parent caching framework)

### Development Dependencies
- **flutter_test**: SDK testing framework
- **flutter_lints**: ^5.0.0 (Code quality and linting)
- **http**: ^1.5.0 (For example implementations)

## Development Environment

### Setup Requirements
- Flutter SDK 3.9.0 or higher
- Dart SDK compatible with Flutter 3.9.0
- IDE with Flutter/Dart support (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.)

### Build Configuration
- **analysis_options.yaml**: Linting rules and analysis configuration
- **pubspec.yaml**: Package metadata and dependencies
- **pubspec.lock**: Locked dependency versions

## Technical Constraints

### Platform Compatibility
- Targets Flutter's supported platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Desktop)
- Uses Hive's cross-platform storage capabilities
- No platform-specific code required

### Performance Requirements
- Must handle large datasets efficiently
- Image caching should not block UI thread
- Memory usage should be reasonable for mobile devices

### Security Considerations
- Supports Hive encryption via `HiveCipher`
- No sensitive data exposed in logs or errors
- Secure storage path configuration

## Development Tools

### Code Quality
- **flutter_lints**: Enforces Dart/Flutter best practices
- **analysis_options.yaml**: Custom linting rules
- Consistent code formatting

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for storage operations
- Example apps for manual testing

### Documentation
- Inline code documentation
- README with usage examples
- API documentation via dartdoc

## Integration Patterns

### With pvcache
- Implements `PVBaseStorage` interface
- Supports `MetadataStorage` mixin
- Compatible with pvcache adapter system

### With Hive
- Uses `BoxCollection` for multi-box management
- Supports custom box creators and configurations
- Handles Hive initialization and cleanup

### With Flutter
- Widget-friendly image caching
- Async/await pattern throughout
- Proper resource management

## Deployment Considerations

### Package Publishing
- Version: 0.0.1 (initial release)
- Homepage: https://github.com/Pathverse/pvcache_hive
- Follows pub.dev publishing guidelines

### Version Management
- Semantic versioning (semver)
- Breaking changes require major version bump
- Backward compatibility maintained where possible

## Known Technical Debt
- README needs completion (currently has TODO placeholders)
- Some example implementations could be more robust
- Error handling could be more comprehensive in edge cases

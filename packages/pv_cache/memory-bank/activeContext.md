# Active Context: PV Cache

## Current Work Focus
âœ… **COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented native Hive serialization with FlutterSecureStorage mock for optimal test environment. All type casting issues resolved, full test suite passing.

## Recent Changes

### ðŸŽ¯ Native Serialization Implementation (COMPLETED)
1. **FlutterSecureStorage Mock**: Complete in-memory implementation eliminating MissingPluginException
   - All abstract methods implemented for full compatibility
   - Map-based storage for consistent test behavior
   - Proper async/await patterns matching production behavior

2. **Storage Architecture Conversion**: From JSON-based to native Map serialization
   - **Box Types**: Changed from `LazyBox<String>` to `LazyBox<dynamic>` for native serialization
   - **Storage Methods**: Updated `_storeRegular` and `_getRegular` for direct Map handling
   - **Type Safety**: Implemented proper `Map<dynamic,dynamic>` to `Map<String,dynamic>` conversion
   - **Performance**: Native Hive serialization for better performance with Map objects

3. **Type Casting Resolution**: Fixed all runtime type errors
   - **storage.dart**: `Map<String, dynamic>.from(data as Map)` for safe conversion
   - **cache.dart**: Added type conversion logic in `getWithOptions` method
   - **Comprehensive Fix**: Handles all Map type casting scenarios properly

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy JSON methods preserved
   - **Encrypted Data**: Still uses JSON encoding for secure string storage
   - **Legacy Support**: `putJsonString` method for explicit JSON operations
   - **Migration Safe**: Existing encrypted data continues to work

### ðŸ§ª Test Environment Success
- **All Tests Passing**: Complete test suite validation with native serialization
- **Mock Integration**: FlutterSecureStorage mock fully integrated
- **Performance**: Better performance with native Map handling vs JSON parsing

## Next Steps
1. **Performance Benchmarking**: Test native serialization performance improvements
2. **Documentation Update**: Document new native serialization approach
3. **Feature Enhancement**: Leverage native Map support for advanced features

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Native Serialization Benefits
- **Performance**: Direct Hive serialization eliminates JSON encode/decode overhead
- **Type Support**: Better support for complex Map objects and nested structures
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced string conversion overhead
- **Developer Experience**: More intuitive Map object handling

### Architecture Patterns
- **Dual Storage Strategy**: Native serialization for regular data, JSON for encrypted data
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Map type conversion handling throughout the stack
- **Mock Strategy**: Complete FlutterSecureStorage mock for reliable test environment
- **Backward Compatibility**: Smooth migration path preserving existing functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Refactoring Strategy
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file now has one clear purpose
- **Minimal Wrapper**: Main wrapper becomes a simple orchestrator
- **Component Isolation**: Each component can be tested and maintained independently
- **Export All**: All components exported for potential external use

### Architecture Improvements
- **Component Isolation**: Isolated functionality into focused modules
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhanced caching and key management
- **Operational Management**: Dedicated tracking and eviction capabilities
- **Shared Utilities**: Common functionality extracted for reuse

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization (Updated)
- **Component-based Architecture**: Related functionality grouped into focused files
- **Clear Interfaces**: Each component has well-defined static methods
- **Dependency Injection**: Components use imports rather than tight coupling
- **Error Isolation**: Failures in one component don't cascade to others

### Refactoring Principles Applied
- **Extract Class**: Large monolithic file split into specialized modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one aspect of functionality
- **Facade Pattern**: Main wrapper provides simple interface to complex subsystem
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different operational aspects properly separated

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Refactoring Success Factors
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests enabled confident refactoring
- **Clear Boundaries**: Natural separation points existed in the original code
- **Incremental Approach**: Split into logical components with clear responsibilities
- **Validation**: All tests pass, confirming no regression in functionality

### Architecture Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Each component can be modified independently
- **Testability**: Individual components can be unit tested in isolation
- **Readability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand
- **Extensibility**: New functionality can be added to specific components

### Performance Considerations
- **No Overhead**: Refactoring maintains all performance optimizations
- **Key Caching**: Encryption key cache preserved in CacheEncryption
- **Lazy Loading**: Storage operations remain optimized
- **Memory Management**: LRU/LFU tracking unchanged

## Context for Future Work
The PV Cache package now has a much cleaner architecture with well-separated concerns. The refactoring demonstrates that complex monolithic files can be successfully split without losing functionality or performance. The new structure makes the codebase more maintainable and easier for new developers to understand.

Key benefits achieved:
- **Large monolith** â†’ **Multiple focused components + simple orchestrator**
- **Single responsibility** for each component
- **All tests passing** with no functionality lost
- **Better maintainability** and **easier debugging**
- **Foundation for future enhancements** in specific areas

The memory bank structure supports both the documentation and the improved code organization, making this a sustainable approach for ongoing development.

# Active Context: PV Cache

## Current State
- PVCache is fully modular and production-ready.
- All core and advanced features are implemented:
  - CRUD, JSON, encryption, sensitive fields, dependency logic, expiry, LRU/LFU, grouping.
- Dependency logic is robust:
  - Supports `ENCRYPTED:x`, `X:Y`, `X:*` patterns.
  - If `sensitive` is set, `depends` always refers to a secure storage key.
- All features are covered by a comprehensive, passing test suite.
- Architecture is component-based, maintainable, and well-documented.

## Next Steps
- Performance tuning for large datasets.
- Expand advanced documentation and real-world usage examples.

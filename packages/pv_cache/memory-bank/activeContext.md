# Active Context: PV Cache

## Current Work Focus
Creating comprehensive documentation and initializing memory bank for the PV Cache package based on existing implementation analysis.

## Recent Changes
1. **README.md Updated**: Replaced placeholder README with comprehensive documentation including:
   - Feature overview with emojis for visual appeal
   - Installation and quick start guides
   - Advanced feature examples (encryption, expiry, sensitive fields, LRU/LFU)
   - Complete API reference
   - Practical examples for common use cases
   - Testing and contribution guidelines

2. **Memory Bank Initialized**: Created foundational memory bank structure with:
   - `projectbrief.md`: Core requirements and project scope
   - `productContext.md`: Problems solved and user experience goals
   - `systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and design patterns
   - `techContext.md`: Technology stack and development setup

## Next Steps
1. **Memory Bank Completion**: Create `progress.md` to document current implementation status
2. **Example App Review**: Ensure example app demonstrates all documented features
3. **Test Coverage Validation**: Verify test suite covers all documented functionality
4. **Documentation Sync**: Ensure code comments align with memory bank documentation

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Documentation Approach
- **User-Centric**: Focus on practical examples and real-world use cases
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, build to advanced features
- **Visual Elements**: Use emojis and code examples for better readability
- **Complete API Coverage**: Document all public methods and options

### Memory Bank Strategy
- **Comprehensive Foundation**: Capture all architectural decisions and patterns
- **Implementation-Driven**: Base documentation on actual code analysis
- **Future-Oriented**: Include considerations for potential enhancements
- **Maintenance-Friendly**: Structure for easy updates as project evolves

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Single responsibility principle for each source file
- Clear separation between public API and implementation details
- CacheWrapper pattern for complex option handling
- Singleton pattern for cache instance management

### Documentation Style
- Practical examples over theoretical explanations
- Code-first approach with extensive examples
- Clear option rules and constraints
- Visual hierarchy with headers and formatting

### Testing Philosophy
- Comprehensive test coverage for all public methods
- Visual testing app for manual verification
- Cross-platform compatibility validation
- Error handling and edge case coverage

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Architecture Insights
- **Wrapper Pattern Success**: CacheWrapper effectively isolates complex option logic
- **Dual Box Strategy**: Separating data and metadata storage improves performance
- **Options Validation**: Early validation prevents invalid configurations
- **Security by Design**: Multiple encryption layers provide defense in depth

### Implementation Patterns
- **Graceful Degradation**: Test environment limitations handled gracefully
- **Type Safety**: Generic methods improve developer experience
- **Error Isolation**: Individual operation failures don't cascade
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and intelligent eviction work well

### Developer Experience
- **Visual Testing**: Example app crucial for understanding and debugging
- **Clear API**: Simple methods with powerful options configuration
- **Comprehensive Examples**: Real-world scenarios demonstrate value
- **Memory Bank**: Documentation structure supports maintenance and evolution

## Context for Future Work
The PV Cache package represents a mature caching solution with sophisticated features. The memory bank captures the current state and architectural decisions to support future development. The comprehensive README provides users with everything needed to effectively use the package, from basic operations to advanced security features.

Key areas for potential future enhancement include network caching integration, custom encryption algorithms, and performance monitoring tools, but the current implementation provides a solid foundation for Flutter applications requiring secure, flexible caching capabilities.

# Product Context: PV Cache

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Flutter developers often struggle with local data caching because:
1. **Security Gaps**: Most caching solutions don't handle sensitive data encryption properly
2. **Limited Flexibility**: Existing packages lack advanced features like selective field encryption, dependency-based invalidation, and intelligent eviction
3. **Poor Developer Experience**: Type safety and configuration options are often inadequate
4. **No Unified API**: Developers need different packages for different caching needs

### Solution Approach
PV Cache provides a comprehensive, unified caching solution that addresses these pain points through:
- **Secure by Default**: Built-in encryption capabilities with secure key management
- **Advanced Configuration**: Rich options system for fine-grained control
- **Type Safety**: Generic methods with compile-time type checking
- **Unified API**: Single package for all caching needs from simple storage to complex scenarios

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For Simple Use Cases
```dart
// Should be this easy for basic usage
final cache = await PVCache.getInstance();
await cache.putWithOptions('key', 'value');
final value = await cache.getWithOptions<String>('key');
```

#### For Advanced Use Cases
```dart
// Should be powerful but not complex
await cache.putWithOptions(
  'sensitive_data',
  {'public': 'visible', 'secret': 'hidden'},
  options: CacheOptions(
    sensitive: ['secret'],
    depends: 'master_key',
    lifetime: 3600,
  ),
);
```

### Core Workflows

#### Secure Data Storage Workflow
1. Developer identifies sensitive data fields
2. Creates master key for dependency
3. Configures CacheOptions with sensitive patterns
4. Data automatically encrypted/decrypted transparently
5. If master key expires/deleted, dependent data becomes inaccessible

#### Cache Management Workflow
1. Developer configures eviction strategy (LRU/LFU)
2. Sets size limits or access patterns
3. Cache automatically manages size and performance
4. Least used/accessed items evicted automatically
5. Performance remains optimal without manual intervention

#### Session Management Workflow
1. Store session data with expiry time
2. Access session data throughout app lifecycle
3. Automatic cleanup when session expires
4. No manual memory management required

## Problems It Solves

### Security Problems
- **Plaintext Storage**: Automatically encrypts sensitive data
- **Key Management**: Handles encryption keys securely via Flutter Secure Storage
- **Selective Protection**: Encrypts only specified fields, not entire objects

### Performance Problems
- **Memory Bloat**: LRU/LFU eviction prevents unbounded cache growth
- **Stale Data**: Automatic expiry ensures fresh data
- **Access Optimization**: Tracks usage patterns for intelligent eviction

### Developer Experience Problems
- **Type Safety**: Generic methods prevent runtime type errors
- **Configuration Complexity**: Simple options object with sensible defaults
- **Testing Difficulty**: Comprehensive test suite and visual example app
- **Documentation Gaps**: Complete API reference and practical examples

## Target Scenarios

### Authentication & Session Management
- Store encrypted access tokens with expiry
- Manage refresh tokens with extended lifetimes
- Handle session invalidation automatically

### User Data Caching
- Cache user profiles with sensitive field protection
- Store preferences and settings locally
- Manage user-generated content with size limits

### API Response Caching
- Cache API responses with automatic expiry
- Implement intelligent eviction for large datasets
- Group related cache entries for batch operations

### Configuration & Settings
- Store app configuration with encryption
- Manage feature flags and remote config
- Handle sensitive API keys and credentials

## Success Metrics
- Reduced time to implement secure caching
- Fewer security vulnerabilities in apps using the package
- Improved app performance through intelligent cache management
- Higher developer satisfaction with type safety and documentation
- Broader adoption across Flutter community

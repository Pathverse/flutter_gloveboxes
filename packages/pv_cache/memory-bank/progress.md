# Progress: PV Cache

## Current Status
- PVCache is fully implemented and tested.
- All features are covered:
  - CRUD, JSON, encryption, sensitive fields, dependency logic, expiry, LRU/LFU, grouping.
- Dependency logic is enforced for `ENCRYPTED:x`, `X:Y`, `X:*`, and sensitive fields always use secure storage for depends.
- Comprehensive test suite passes for all scenarios.
- No known issues or regressions.
- Ready for production use and further optimization.

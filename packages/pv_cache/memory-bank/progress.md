# PV Cache: Progress

## Current Status
- Package has been completely overhauled with advanced caching features
- All core methods have been implemented with pre/post operation system
- New modular architecture with persistent tracking capabilities
- SHA1 hash system replaces UUID for meta box names
- Smart fragments with dynamic key generation and field interpolation
- Modular function architecture with single-responsibility design

## What's Implemented
- **Core Infrastructure**:
  - `PVCacheCentral`: Core storage operations with SHA1 hash generation
  - `PVCacheEnvConfig`: Abstract configuration interface with pre/post methods
  - `PVCacheStorageType`: Base class for storage types
  - `PVCache`: Complete API implementation with key validation

- **Storage Types**:
  - `SimpleExpiry`: Time-based expiration with automatic cleanup
  - `SimpleLRU`: Least Recently Used eviction with persistent access tracking
  - `SimpleLFU`: Least Frequently Used eviction with persistent frequency tracking
  - `Encrypted`: Secure storage with expiry support
  - `AdvancedFragment`: Hierarchical caching with fragment resolution, smart fragments, and callback-based loading

- **Advanced Features**:
  - Multi-environment support with `{env}:{key}` format parsing
  - Advanced fragment caching with data fragmentation  
  - Smart fragments with dynamic key generation using field interpolation
  - Performance optimization with cache miss handling toggle
  - Pre/post operation system with callback-based loading
  - Special key protection (`__key__` format reserved)
  - Persistent tracking across browser restarts
  - Physical cleanup of expired/evicted cache entries
  - Glob pattern matching for flexible data path matching
  - Modular function architecture with single-responsibility design

## Implementation Details

### Pre/Post Operation System
- `preGet(String key, dynamic originalValue)`: Pre-processing for get operations
- `preSet(String key, dynamic value, Map<String, dynamic>? metadata)`: Pre-processing for set operations
- `preDelete(String key)`: Pre-processing for delete operations
- `postGet(String key, dynamic value)`: Post-processing for get operations
- `postSet(String key, dynamic value)`: Post-processing for set operations
- `postDelete(String key)`: Post-processing for delete operations

### PVCache Static Methods
- `init()`: Initializes the cache system
- `set(String key, dynamic value, {Map<String, dynamic>? metadata})`: Stores data with validation
- `get(String key, {bool expiredReturnsNull = true})`: Retrieves data with pre/post processing
- `delete(String key)`: Removes data and metadata with validation
- `clear({String? env})`: Clears all data for specified environment
- `pop(String key)`: Retrieves and removes data
- `setEnv(String env, PVCacheEnvConfig config)`: Sets environment configuration

### Smart Fragment System
- `SmartFragment(pathPattern, nameResolve)`: Dynamic key generation with field interpolation
- `generateKey(Map<String, dynamic> data)`: Replaces `{field}` placeholders with actual values
- `matchesPath(String path)`: Uses glob patterns to match data paths
- Field interpolation supports multiple fields: `"user_{id}_{name}"`
- Glob pattern matching: `"x/x*"` matches hierarchical data paths
- Semantic key generation based on data content rather than arbitrary paths

### Modular Function Architecture
- `_fetchDataFromCallback()`: Handles callback execution and error handling
- `_hasFragments()`: Checks if config has any type of fragments
- `_processFragments()`: Orchestrates fragment processing
- `_processRegularFragments()`: Handles traditional path-based fragments
- `_processSmartFragments()`: Handles dynamic key generation fragments
- `_storeFragmentData()`: Orchestrates storage of all fragment types
- `_storeRegularFragments()`: Stores traditional fragments
- `_storeSmartFragments()`: Stores dynamically-keyed fragments
- `_getDataAtPath()`: Utility to extract data at specific paths

### Special Key Protection
- Keys starting and ending with `__` are reserved for internal use
- `__access_times__`: Stores access timestamps for LRU/LFU tracking
- `__access_counts__`: Stores access frequencies for LFU tracking
- Validation prevents users from creating special keys manually

### Persistent Tracking
- LRU/LFU caches maintain access patterns across browser restarts
- Tracking data stored in metadata using special keys
- Lazy initialization rebuilds tracking maps from persistent storage
- Automatic saving of tracking data on every operation

## Architecture Benefits
- Better restraint and modularity
- Controls completely separate from storage logic
- Environment-based configuration system
- Clear separation between configuration, storage, and API layers
- Type safety maintained throughout
- Persistent behavior across browser restarts
- Protection against internal key conflicts
- Efficient SHA1 hash system for meta box names
- Smart key generation for semantic cache access
- Modular design for maintainable and extensible code
- Single-responsibility functions for better testing and debugging

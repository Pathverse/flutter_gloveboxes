# Active Context: pvtro

## Current Work Focus
The pvtro system is **functionally complete** with both runtime and build-time components working successfully. Recent focus has been on:

1. **Advanced Testing Scenarios**: User requested shadcn_ui integration to test complex provider chaining
2. **Developer Experience**: Creating realistic example applications that demonstrate real-world usage
3. **Documentation Polish**: Ensuring generated code and APIs are properly documented

## Recent Changes
- ✅ Fixed code generation ordering (imports now appear at top of generated files)
- ✅ Updated trigger file comments to reflect current functionality  
- ✅ Successfully tested with real slang packages (pvtro_common, pvtro_conver)
- ✅ Generated clean UnifiedLanguage enum with 13 language codes
- ✅ Verified LocaleCubit coordination works across multiple packages

## Next Steps
User has requested implementation of advanced UI testing scenario:
- **shadcn_ui Integration**: Add shadcn_ui components for testing complex provider patterns
- **Language Toggle UI**: Implement dropdown for switching between all 13+ supported languages
- **Complex Widget Tree**: Test pvtro coordination in realistic app architecture
- **slang context.t Usage**: Demonstrate proper usage of slang's context-based translation patterns

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### UI Testing Strategy
- Use shadcn_ui for modern, complex component patterns
- Implement language toggle to verify real-time locale switching
- Create realistic widget hierarchy to test provider composition
- Demonstrate both common and converter package usage

### Code Quality Focus
- All generated code should be properly formatted with imports at top
- Comments should accurately reflect current functionality
- Error handling should provide clear feedback for debugging
- Example applications should follow Flutter best practices

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Generated Code Structure
```dart
// GENERATED CODE - DO NOT MODIFY BY HAND
// Generated by pvtro_builder  
// Found N slang packages with M unique locales

import 'package:pvtro/cubit.dart';

import 'package:package1/i18n/strings.g.dart' as package1_i18n;
import 'package:package2/i18n/strings.g.dart' as package2_i18n;

enum UnifiedLanguage { /* clean enum values */ }
// ... rest of generated code
```

### User Preferences
- **No Shortcuts**: User explicitly rejected cutting corners on implementation
- **Complete Testing**: Wants advanced scenarios to validate robustness
- **Real-World Usage**: Prefers realistic examples over simple demos
- **Modern UI**: Specifically requested shadcn_ui for advanced component testing

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
1. **Path Resolution Complexity**: package_config.json paths can be inconsistent, requiring adjustment logic
2. **Regex Parsing Challenges**: slang-generated enums include complex syntax that needs careful filtering
3. **Build System Integration**: build_runner requires specific asset handling and builder configuration
4. **Import Management**: Generated code structure is crucial for maintainability

### Development Insights  
1. **Incremental Testing**: Testing with real packages revealed issues not found with mocks
2. **User-Driven Quality**: User feedback prevented premature simplification
3. **Documentation Accuracy**: Generated comments must stay synchronized with functionality
4. **Example Importance**: Realistic examples are crucial for user adoption

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Generic Design Success**: LocaleCubit<T> pattern successfully avoids import conflicts
2. **Function-Based Coordination**: LocaleSetter functions provide clean package coordination
3. **Build-Time Discovery**: Automatic package scanning eliminates manual configuration
4. **Code Generation Value**: Generated code provides both type safety and convenience

## Current System Status

### Fully Working Components
- ✅ **LocaleCubit<T>**: Generic locale state management
- ✅ **MultiTranslationProvider**: Widget composition helper
- ✅ **AppLocaleScanner**: Package discovery and analysis
- ✅ **UnifiedLanguageGenerator**: Clean code generation  
- ✅ **Build Integration**: Seamless build_runner workflow
- ✅ **Example Generation**: Working pvtro_example project

### Integration Status
- ✅ **Real Package Testing**: Successfully tested with pvtro_common, pvtro_conver
- ✅ **13 Language Support**: All discovered languages properly coordinated
- ✅ **Path Resolution**: Local package dependencies handled correctly
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Build failures provide clear feedback

### Ready for Production
The core pvtro system is production-ready with:
- Type-safe locale coordination across unlimited packages
- Zero import conflicts between package-specific AppLocale enums  
- Automatic discovery and setup via build_runner
- Clean, documented generated code
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Current Task**: Implementing advanced UI testing scenario with shadcn_ui to validate system under complex real-world conditions.

## Known Issues

### Resolved Issues âœ…
- ~~Import placement in generated files~~ â†’ Fixed: imports now at top
- ~~Path resolution for local packages~~ â†’ Fixed: adjustment logic added
- ~~Regex parsing of complex enums~~ â†’ Fixed: keyword filtering implemented
- ~~Documentation accuracy~~ â†’ Fixed: comments synchronized with functionality

### No Current Blocking Issues
All core functionality is working correctly. Current work is enhancement-focused rather than bug-fixing.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture Decisions (Validated)
- **Two-Package Split**: Separating runtime from build-time concerns proved correct
- **Generic Cubit Design**: LocaleCubit<T> successfully avoids all import conflicts
- **Function-Based Coordination**: LocaleSetter pattern provides clean package boundaries
- **Build-Time Discovery**: Automatic scanning eliminates manual configuration burden

### Implementation Lessons Learned
1. **Real Package Testing Essential**: Mock testing missed several edge cases
2. **Code Generation Structure Matters**: Import order and documentation significantly impact usability
3. **User-Driven Quality**: Feedback prevents premature optimization and corner-cutting
4. **Build Integration Complexity**: build_runner requires careful asset and path management

### Architectural Validation âœ… ENHANCED AND COMPLETE
The core architecture has proven robust through multiple evolution phases:
- Multi-package real-world testing âœ…
- Complex enum parsing scenarios âœ…
- Path resolution edge cases âœ…
- Build system integration challenges âœ…
- User feedback and requirements evolution âœ…
- **Advanced UI integration testing âœ…**
- **Complex provider composition validation âœ…**
- **Production-scale example application âœ…**
- **âœ… NEW**: Major architectural refactoring with utility framework
- **âœ… NEW**: CLI tool integration and developer workflow enhancement
- **âœ… NEW**: Professional code generation and documentation standards
- **âœ… NEW**: Enhanced maintainability and extensibility validation

**Enhanced Achievement**: The pvtro system has successfully evolved through major architectural improvements while preserving all existing functionality. The new utility-based architecture provides:
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Clean separation of concerns with reusable utilities
- **Professional Standards**: Enterprise-quality code generation and documentation
- **Developer Productivity**: CLI tools for enhanced workflows and debugging
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Extensible foundation for additional features
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved through evolution

The pvtro system is now **architecturally enhanced and production-ready** with comprehensive utility framework, CLI tools, and professional-grade code generation.

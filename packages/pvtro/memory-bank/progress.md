# Progress: pvtro

## What Works (Production Ready)

### âœ… Core Runtime System
- **LocaleCubit<T>**: Generic locale state management with type safety
  - Avoids import conflicts by using generic type parameter
  - Supports unlimited package coordination via LocaleSetter functions
  - Includes system locale detection and error handling
- **MultiTranslationProvider**: Widget composition helper for provider trees
- **Package Isolation**: No direct imports of package-specific AppLocale enums

### âœ… Code Generation Pipeline  
- **AppLocaleScanner**: Automatic package discovery and analysis
  - Scans package_config.json for all project dependencies
  - Finds slang-generated strings.g.dart files in standard locations
  - Extracts AppLocale enum values with robust regex parsing
  - Filters out Dart keywords and validates language codes
- **UnifiedLanguageGenerator**: Clean, documented code generation
  - Creates UnifiedLanguage enum with all discovered locales
  - Generates extension methods for language code conversion  
  - Creates package-specific parser functions
  - Produces factory function for cubit setup
- **Build Runner Integration**: Seamless development workflow
  - Watches pvtro.dart trigger files for changes
  - Integrates with standard Flutter build system
  - Handles incremental builds and asset management

### âœ… Real-World Validation
- **Multi-Package Testing**: Successfully tested with pvtro_common + pvtro_conver
- **13 Language Coordination**: All discovered languages properly synchronized
- **Path Resolution**: Handles monorepo local dependencies correctly  
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing packages/locales

### âœ… Generated Code Quality
- **Clean Structure**: Imports at top, proper formatting throughout
- **Documentation**: Generated comments explain package mappings and usage
- **Type Safety**: Full compile-time checking restored across package boundaries
- **Maintainable Output**: Human-readable generated code for debugging

## What's Left to Build

### ðŸ”„ Advanced Testing Scenarios (In Progress)
**Current Task**: Implementing complex UI testing with shadcn_ui
- Modern component integration for realistic app scenarios
- Language toggle UI demonstrating all 13+ supported languages  
- Complex provider composition testing
- Real slang context.t usage patterns

### ðŸ“‹ Future Enhancements (Not Blocking)
- **CLI Tool**: Standalone pvtro command for project setup
- **IDE Integration**: VS Code extension for pvtro project management
- **Advanced Error Reporting**: Better build failure diagnostics
- **Performance Optimizations**: Faster builds for large monorepos
- **Configuration Options**: Custom enum names, output locations

## Current Status

### Development State: **PRODUCTION READY** 
The core pvtro system is fully functional and ready for real-world usage:
- Zero import conflicts between slang packages âœ…
- Automatic locale coordination across unlimited packages âœ…  
- Type-safe unified language management âœ…
- Seamless build_runner integration âœ…
- Clean, documented generated code âœ…

### Last Completed Milestone
**Code Generation Quality Polish** (Recently Completed)
- Fixed import ordering in generated files
- Updated trigger file documentation  
- Verified all generated code follows best practices
- Confirmed system works with real distributed slang packages

### Current Milestone  
**Advanced UI Testing Integration** (In Progress)
- Adding shadcn_ui components for complex scenario testing
- Implementing realistic language switching UI
- Validating provider chaining under real-world conditions
- Demonstrating best practices for slang context.t usage

## Known Issues

### Resolved Issues âœ…
- ~~Import placement in generated files~~ â†’ Fixed: imports now at top
- ~~Path resolution for local packages~~ â†’ Fixed: adjustment logic added
- ~~Regex parsing of complex enums~~ â†’ Fixed: keyword filtering implemented
- ~~Documentation accuracy~~ â†’ Fixed: comments synchronized with functionality

### No Current Blocking Issues
All core functionality is working correctly. Current work is enhancement-focused rather than bug-fixing.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Architecture Decisions (Validated)
- **Two-Package Split**: Separating runtime from build-time concerns proved correct
- **Generic Cubit Design**: LocaleCubit<T> successfully avoids all import conflicts
- **Function-Based Coordination**: LocaleSetter pattern provides clean package boundaries
- **Build-Time Discovery**: Automatic scanning eliminates manual configuration burden

### Implementation Lessons Learned
1. **Real Package Testing Essential**: Mock testing missed several edge cases
2. **Code Generation Structure Matters**: Import order and documentation significantly impact usability
3. **User-Driven Quality**: Feedback prevents premature optimization and corner-cutting
4. **Build Integration Complexity**: build_runner requires careful asset and path management

### Architectural Validation
The core architecture has proven robust through:
- Multi-package real-world testing
- Complex enum parsing scenarios  
- Path resolution edge cases
- Build system integration challenges
- User feedback and requirements evolution

**Next Evolution**: Advanced UI integration will validate the system under complex real-world application architectures and demonstrate full production readiness.

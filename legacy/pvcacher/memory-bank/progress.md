# Progress Tracking

## Completed Components

### Core System
- **PVCacher**: Factory pattern, singleton management, exposed instances
- **Adapter System**: Mixin-based capabilities with lifecycle integration
- **Context Management**: Rich context objects with shared state and result handling
- **Handle Interface**: Complex lifecycle hooks (beforeAnything, afterAnything, operation-specific)
- **Static Interface**: PVCACHER class with alias support and conflict detection

### Template Implementations
- **StdHandler**: Hive persistence with SHA256 hashing and metadata caching
- **StdObject**: Serialization with simple/complex value detection
- **HiveCollectionTop0**: Shared infrastructure for template consistency
- **Serialize utilities**: Value detection and JSON conversion

## Current Implementation State

### Working Systems
- Multi-level singleton management (PVCacher + PVCACHER)
- Complex operation pipeline with adapter coordination  
- Hash-based metadata with separate storage
- Alias system with namespace conflict detection
- Context enrichment and lifecycle management

### Template Architecture
- StdHandler demonstrates production patterns
- Shared infrastructure through HiveCollectionTop0
- Metadata architecture with SHA256 keys
- Object serialization with flexible value handling

## Remaining Tasks

### Immediate
- Main export file update (pvcacher.dart)
- Package documentation alignment
- Test coverage expansion

### Template Expansion
- Expiration adapter implementation
- Memory handle template
- Additional adapter patterns

### System Completion
- Documentation updates reflecting actual architecture
- Example implementations
- Performance optimization

## Technical Debt
- Main export still contains placeholder code
- Test coverage minimal
- Package metadata needs updating
- Some template files empty

## Architecture Status
- Core: Complete and functional
- Templates: StdHandler complete, others needed
- Static Interface: Complete with advanced features
- Documentation: Needs alignment with implementation

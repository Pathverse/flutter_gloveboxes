# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Successfully implemented preHandlerOperation and postHandlerOperation hooks, resolving critical timing issue with expiry adapter functionality.

## Project State
The PVCacher system is now **fully functional** with complete core architecture, sophisticated template implementations, and working adapter ecosystem:

### Core Components - WORKING
- **PVCacher**: Factory pattern with singleton namespace management + comprehensive docstrings
- **PVCACHER**: Static interface with alias/namespace resolution  
- **StdHandler**: Production template with Hive persistence, SHA256 hashing, metadata caching
- **Context System**: Rich context objects with shared state and lifecycle management
- **Adapter Hooks**: **NEW** - preHandlerOperation/postHandlerOperation timing resolved

### Recent Major Achievements
1. **Adapter Hook Timing Fix**: Implemented preHandlerOperation/postHandlerOperation hooks that run after metadata loading
2. **Expiry Adapter Success**: ExpiredAdapter now properly evicts expired items using new hook timing  
3. **Complete Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings to all PVCacher methods and ExpiredAdapter functionality
4. **Debug Infrastructure**: VerboseExpiredAdapter provides detailed expiry operation logging

## Active Implementation Status

### Adapter System - FULLY WORKING
- **Hook Execution Order**: 
  ```
  beforeAnything → preHandlerOperation → operation → postHandlerOperation → afterAnything
  ```
- **ExpiredAdapter**: Automatically removes expired items during get operations
- **VerboseExpiredAdapter**: Provides detailed logging for debugging expiry behavior
- **ExpiryUtils**: Convenient helper methods for creating expiry options

### Critical Bug Fixes Completed
- **Missing await in init()**: Fixed handler initialization 
- **Mixin naming inconsistency**: Corrected hasPostset vs hasPostSet
- **Hook timing issue**: preHandlerOperation runs after metadata loading
- **Missing return statement**: Fixed get operation return value handling

## Current Architecture Understanding
- **Adapter Hook Lifecycle**: Full lifecycle with timing-critical hooks implemented
- **Metadata Access**: preHandlerOperation ensures expiry adapters can access loaded metadata
- **Expiry Functionality**: Complete UTC timestamp-based expiry with automatic cleanup
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings explaining all functionality and timing

## Immediate Status: WORKING SYSTEM
All core functionality operational:
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations
- ✅ Adapter pattern with full lifecycle  
- ✅ Expiry functionality with automatic eviction
- ✅ Debug adapters with comprehensive logging
- ✅ Metadata persistence and loading
- ✅ Template infrastructure complete
